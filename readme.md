## Git Hub Landing Page
The goal of this project is to position attacks on ML systems in an ATT&CK-style framework so that security analysts can orient themselves
in this new and upcoming threats.

## Adversarial ML 101 
Informally, Adversarial ML is "subverting machine learning systems for fun and profit". The methods underpinning the production machine learning systems are systematically vulnerable to a new class of vulnerabilities across the machine learning supply chain collectively known as Adversarial Machine Learning. Adversaries can exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate AI systems in order to alter their behavior to serve a malicious end goal.

Consider a typical ML pipeline shown in the left that is gated behind an API, wherein the only way to use the model is to send a query and observe an response. In this example, we assume a blackbox setting: the attacker does **NOT** have direct access to the training data, no knowledge of the algorithm used and no source code of the model. The attacker only queries the model and observes the response.

Here are some of the adversarial ML attacks that an adversary can perform on this system:
| Attack 		 				| Overview	|
| :---							| :---
| Evasion Attack 				| Attacker modifies the query to get appropriate response. The attacker can find the just-the-right query to get the desired response algorithmically	|
| Poisoning attack 				| Attacker contaminates the training phase of ML systems to get intended result		|
| Model Inversion 				| Attacker recovers the secret features used in the model through careful queries	| 
| Membership Inference  		| Attacker can infer if given data record was part of the model's training dataset or not |
| Model Stealing        		| Attacker is able to recover a functionally equivalent model with similar fidelity as original model by constructing careful queries | 
| Model Replication     		| Attacker is able to recover functionally equivalent model (but generally with lower fidelity) | 
| Reprogramming ML system       | Repurpose the ML system to perform an activity it was not programmed for | 
| Attacking the ML supply chain | Attacker compromises the ML models as it is being downloaded for use | 
| Exploit Software Dependencies | Attacker uses traditional software exploits like buffer overflow or hardware exploits like GPU trojans to attain their goal. |

## Finer points 
1.  This does not cover all kinds of attacks. Adversarial ML is an active area of research with new classes constantly being discovered.
2.  These attacks are applicable to ML models in different paradigms, ML models on premise, on cloud, on Edge.
3.  Though the illustration shows blackbox attacks, these attacks have also been shown to work in whitebox (where the attacker has access to either model architecture, code or training data) settings
4.  Though we were not specific about what kind of data - image, audio, timeseries, or tabular data, research has shown that of these attacks have shown to exist in all the data types

## Why Adversarial ML Threat Matrix? 
1.  In the last three years, major companies such as [Google](https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-best-image-recognition-system-flummoxed-by-fakes/), [Amazon]           (https://www.fastcompany.com/90240975/alexa-can-be-hacked-by-chirping-birds), [Microsoft](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/24/tay-microsofts-ai-         chatbot-gets-a-crash-course-in-racism-from-twitter), and [Tesla](https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/three-small-stickers-on-         road-can-steer-tesla-autopilot-into-oncoming-lane), have had their ML systems tricked, evaded, or misled.
2.  This trend is only set to rise: According to [Gartner report](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3939991). 30% of cyberattacks by 2022 will involve data poisoning, model     theft or adversarial examples.
3.  However, industry is underprepared. In a [survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05646.pdf) of 28 organizations spanning small as well as large organizations, 25           organizations did not know how to secure their ML systems.

Unlike traditional cybersecurity vulnerabilities that are tied to specific software and hardware systems, adversarial ML vulnerabilities are enabled by inherent limitations underlying ML algorithms. As a result, data can now be weaponized in new ways requiring that we extend the way we model cyber adversary behavior, reflecting emerging threat vectors and the rapidly evolving adversarial machine learning attack lifecycle.

This threat matrix came out of partnership with 12 industry and academic research groups with the goal of empowering security analysts to orient themselves in this new and upcoming threats. **We are seeding this framework with a curated set of vulnerabilities and adversary behaviors that Microsoft and MITRE have vetted to be effective against production ML systems** Since the primary audience is security analysts, we used ATT&CK as template to position attacks on ML systems given its popularity and wide adoption in the industry.

## Structure of Adversarial ML Threat Matrix
Because it is fashioned after [ATT&CK Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/), the Adversarial ML Threat Matrix retains the terminologies: for instance, the column heads of the Threat Matrix are called "Tactics" and the individual entities are called "Techniques".

However, there are two main differences:

1.  ATT&CK Enterprise is generally designed for corporate network which is composed of many sub components like workstation, bastion hosts, database, network gear,         active directory, cloud component and so on. The tactics of ATT&CK enterprise (initial access, persistence, etc) are really a short hand of saying initial access       to *corporate network;* persistence *in corporate network.* In Adversarial ML Threat Matrix, we acknowledge that ML systems are part of corporate network but           wanted to highlight the uniqueness of the attacks.

    **Difference:** In the Adversarial ML Threat Matrix, the "Tactics" should be read as "reconnaissance of ML subsystem", "persistence in ML subsystem", "evading the      ML subsystem"

2.  When we analyzed real-world attacks on ML systems, we found out that attackers can pursue different strategies: Rely on traditional cybersecurity technique only;       Rely on Adversarial ML techniques only; or Employ a combination of traditional cybersecurity techniques and ML techniques.
  
    **Difference:** In Adversarial ML Threat Matrix, "Techniques" come in two flavors:
        -   Techniques in orange are specific to ML systems
        -   Techniques in white are applicable to both ML and non-ML systems and come directly from Enterprise ATT&CK

        Note: The Adversarial ML Threat Matrix is not yet part of the ATT&CK matrix.

## Things to keep in mind before you use the framework:
1.  This is a **first cut attempt** at collating known adversary techniques against ML Systems. We plan to iterate on the framework based on feedback from the security     and adversarial machine learning community (please engage with us and help make the matrix better!). Net-Net: This is a *living document* that will be routinely       updated.
2.  Only known bad is listed in the Matrix. Adversarial ML is an active area of research with new classes constantly being discovered. If you find a technique that is     not listed, please enlist it in the framework (see section on Feedback)
3.  We are not prescribing definitive defenses at this point - The world of adversarial. We are already in conversations to add best practices in future revisions such     as adversarial training for adversarial examples, restricting the number of significant digits in confidence score for model stealing.
4.  This is not a risk prioritization framework - The Threat Matrix only collates the known techniques; it does not provide a means to prioritize the risks.

### ClearviewAI Misconfiguration 
**Summary of Incident:** Clearview AI's source code repository, though password protected, was misconfigured. This allowed an external researcher to register as a new user to the code repository and gain access to Clearview AI's credentials, keys to cloud storage buckets containing 70K video samples, copies of its applications and Slack tokens.

**Mapping to Adversarial Threat Matrix :**
- In this scenario, a security researcher gained initial access to via a "Valid Account" that was created through a misconfiguration. No Adversarial ML techniques were used.
- these kinds of attacks illustrate that any attempt to secure ML system should be on top of "traditional" good cybersecurity hygiene such as locking down the system with least privileges, multi factor authentication and monitoring and auditing.

### GPT-2 Model Replication 
**Summary of Incident:** : OpenAI built GPT-2, a powerful natural language model and calling it "too dangerous to release" adopted a staged-release process to incrementally release 1.5 Billion parameter model. Before the 1.5B parameter model could be released by OpenAI, two ML researchers replicated the model and released it to the public. *Note this is a model replication attack: Here, attacker is able to recover functionally equivalent model (but generally with lower fidelity), perhaps to do reconnaissance (See proof point attack). In Model stealing, the fidelity of the model is comparable to the original, victim model.*

    - https://www.wired.com/story/dangerous-ai-open-source/

**Mapping to Adversarial Threat Matrix :**
-   Using public documentation about GPT-2, ML researchers gathered similar datasets used during the original GPT-2 training.
-   Next, they used a different publicly available NLP model (called Grover) and modified Grover's objective function to reflect
    GPT-2's objective function,
-   The researchers then trained the modified Grover on the dataset they curated, using Grover's initial hyperparameters, which
    resulted in their replicated model.

### ProofPoint Evasion 
**Summary of Incident:** : CVE-2019-20634 describes how ML researchers evaded ProofPoint's email protection system by first building a copy-cat email protection ML model, and using the insights to evade the live system.

**Reported by:** Will Pearce (@moo_hax), Nick Landers (@monoxgas)
**Source:**
    - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-20634

**Mapping to Adversarial Threat Matrix :**
-   The researchers first gathered the scores from the Proofpoint's ML system used in email email headers .
-   Using these scores, the researchers replicated the ML mode by building a "shadow" aka copy-cat ML model
-   Next, the ML researchers algorithmically found samples that this "offline" copy cat model
-   Finally, these insights from the offline model allowed the researchers to create malicious emails that received preferrable
    scores from the real ProofPoint email protection system, hence bypassing it.

### Tay Poisoning 
 **Summary of Incident:** Microsoft created Tay, a twitter chatbot for 18- to 24- year-olds in the U.S. for entertainment purposes. Within 24 hours of its deployment, Tay had to be decommissioned because it tweeted reprehrensible words.
 
 **Source:**
    - https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2016/03/25/learning-tays-introduction/

**Mapping to Adversarial Threat Matrix :**
-   Tay bot used the interactions with its twitter users as training data to improve its conversations.
-   Average users of Twitter coordinated together with the intent of defacing Tay bot by exploiting this feedback loop
-   As a result of this coordinated attack, Tay's training data was poisoned which led its conversation algorithms to generate more reprehensible material

### Microsoft Red Team Exercise 
**Summary of Incident:** : The Azure Red Team and Azure Trustworthy ML team performed a red team exercise on an internal Azure service with the intention of disrupting its service

**Reported by:** Azure TrustworthyML Team (<atml@microsoft.com>), Azure Red Team
**Mapping to Adversarial Threat Matrix :**
-   The team first performed reconnaissance to gather information about the target ML model
-   Then, using a valid account the team found the model file of the target ML model and the necessary training data
-   Using this, the red team performed an offline evasion attack by methodically searching for adversarial examples
-   Via an exposed API interface, the team performed an online evasion attack by replaying the adversarial examples, which helped achieve this goal.
-   This operation had a combination of traditional ATT&CK enterprise techniques such as finding Valid account, and Executing code via an API -- all interleaved with adversarial ML specific steps such as offline and online evasion examples.

### Bosch Team Experience with EdgeAI 
**Summary of Incident:** : Bosch team performed a research exercise on an internal edge AI system with a dual intention to extract the model and craft adversarial example to evade
**Reported by:** Manoj Parmar (@mparmar47)
**Mapping to Adversarial Threat Matrix :**
-   The team first performed reconnaissance to gather information about the edge AI system device working with sensor interface
-   Then, using a trusted relationship mechanism between sensor and edge ai system team fed synthetic data on sensor to extract the model
-   Using this, the team performed an offline evasion attack by crafting adversarial example with help of extracted model
-   Via an exposed sensor interface, the team performed an online evasion attack by replaying the adversarial examples, which helped achieve this goal.
-   This operation had a combination of traditional ATT&CK industrial control system techniques such as supply chain compromise via sensor, and Executing code via sensor interface. all interleaved with adversarial ML specific steps such as,
  - offline and online evasion examples.
- The team was also able to reconstruct the edge ai system with extracted model
